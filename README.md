Chickens-R-Us

**Description:**	
	The purpose of this project is to create a website that will allow users to view chickens via a webcam and ultimately order eggs from their desired chicken. The website will have an interactive homepage that will have a navigational carousel that will mainly show images of chickens and once clicked on a specific chicken image it will redirect to the respective farm in which the chicken is housed in. The farm pages will have its own personal autobiography and explain a typical day in the life of their chicken. On the same page, there will be a video feed that will show the chickens in real time so that the user can get a look at the quality of life of their chicken before choosing. Once the user is ready to order they will do so via a form that will ask for their personal information. Once the purchase is complete, a receipt will be sent to the user, and will also print a shipping label from the information entered. This shipping label will be sent to the farmer so that they can handle the shipping. The website will have an about us page, that will detail our journey into this business. There will be a feedback/review page that will allow users to either review a farm chicken and/or tell us about a bug in the website. This also includes any recommendations that may make the quality of life of the user/farmer easier when on the site. 


**Webcam:**
* The webcam will be available live (maybe 24/7), so that the user can view the various chickens in the many farms. 
* The webcam is 720p so that the user will have a good look/view on the chicken of their choosing. 

**Website/UI:**	
* Interactive homepage, that will display a carousel that will show the farms we are partnered with

* The website will contain a form that will gather a sign-up and login page. This form will request an Email, First Name, Last Name, 
Password, and Username. Then if the user forgets his password or email, then it will email them a link that will redirect them to the website once again except this time it will ask for a new password. 

* There will be a navigation bar at the top of the homepage that will give the user : About us, Feedback 

* The website will also have a form to make purchases, and enter credit card information.

* There shall be a database to save all user info.

* When the user is ready, the website will offer at least 3 different farms for users to choose from

**Farm(s) Page:** 

* This about us page will contain a list of farmers and a description of their farms as well as a picture of their chickens. 
* It will contain a picture of their location (google maps), so that the user will know where the farm is from.

* There will be a total of 5 different farms showing their own themed page such as a bright colored themed page, a dark colored themed page, etc.

**Purchase:**
* Once purchase is done, the receipt will be sent to the userâ€™s email that was filled out in the form. Use the data in the form (that was filled out in the sign-in page) and use it to create a receipt. Send the information to the farmer as well.
	

**About Us:**
* This about us page will contain a list of farmers and a description of their farms as well as a picture of a their company. I will also add a picture of their location (google maps), so that the user will know where the farm is from.

**Feedback/Review:**
* Find a bug? Report it to us!
* This feature will create a text area parameter that will allow the user to send a review (and possibly incorporate a rating system, such as 5 star rating system, interactive review).
